# Webscraper-Aufbaubank
Search for new jobs at https://www.aufbaubank.de/Karriere

I wrote this tool to learn python and at first some webscaping.

The tool check the website for jobs and compare it with an older search.
This result was saved at the temp directory.

After this the new search override the old search.

So I can track which jobentry is different. 

Just a litte fun :)
